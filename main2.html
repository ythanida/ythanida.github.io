    my work focuses on photography and also video production. In order to not only grow in knowledge and find my signature as a photographer,<br>
    but to be able to grow as a person too, I seek to explore different types of media of work in the photography area.<br>
    and I wish to continue to work and accomplish at a high level.<br>
    I have a strong belief that in order to succeed one must love and have a true passion for the particular activity one is set to achieve,<br>
    in order to accomplish it. Therefore, I am convinced that my true passion to seek opportunities to improve my ability as a photographer/artist,<br>
    as well as the spirit I have for my future aspiration, will take me far. For this reason, through the years I have continued to accomplished work and explore outside my comfort zone.</p>
